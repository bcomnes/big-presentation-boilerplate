# big-presentation-boilerplate

My presentation setup, ready to fork

```
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

Then edit your slides.

- Static assets go in src/static.
- Your big slides go into src/index.html
- `src/index.js` is your app entrypoint.  Do whatever!
- `src/index.css` is your style entrypoint.  Go hog wild!

Compatible with netlify:

- Command: `npm run build`
- Folder: `site`
